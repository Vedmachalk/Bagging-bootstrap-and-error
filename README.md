Here you can find my version bootstrap and bagging.<br/>
Moreover, I computed the bias, the variance and the error of algorithms and distinguish between effectiveness of them with linear regression, decision tree regressor and random forest regressor.<br/>
As an example of the dataset I used Boston dataset.<br/>
Due to that dataset I proved that bagging is good algorithm, but sometimes the easiest way is the best way. In other words, bagging isn't work in some cases better then the simplest methods.<br/>
